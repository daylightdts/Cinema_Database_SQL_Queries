# SQL_Cinema_Project



## The Situation

The companyâ€™s insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance company's underwriters need some updated information from us before they will issue a new policy.

## The Letter

Dear Deluxe Movie Management

In our review of your policy renewal application, we have realized that your business information has not been updated in a number of years.
In order to accurately assess and approve your policy renewal, we will need you to provide all the following information.

Sincerely,
Joe Sheff, Lead Underwriter

## The Objective

As the database and data analyst of Deluxe Cinemas, I am required to leverage my SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Deluxe Cinema 
database to answer the underwriter's questions.
Each of the questions can be answered by querying just one table. As an analyst, my job is to determine which table.
